# Introduction

`Breadth.me` offers a statistical overview of the market breadth. It is designed to assist investors in gaining a clearer understanding of sector and factor performance, highlighting relative strengths and weaknesses.

<br>

# Usage

Some example use cases

- Adjust profolio weightings based on the sector strength and rotation.
- Average breadth score reflects the overall market risk factor. In a bull market, if sector breadth is below 20, it’s a good time to buy. In both bull and bear markets, if it’s above 85, it’s a good time to sell.
- Standard deviation can help determine whether the current market is experiencing overall market risk or a sector/factor rotation. Higher values suggest that a rotation is more likely, while lower values indicate a greater probability of market risk.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Add alerts based on defined conditions
- [ ] Add more groups (e.g., Russell 2000) sector breadth.
